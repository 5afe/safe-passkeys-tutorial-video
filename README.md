Before progressing with the tutorial, please make sure you have:

- Downloaded and installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Created an API key from [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/).


## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/5afe/safe-passkeys-tutorial-video
cd safe-passkeys-tutorial-video
pnpm i
```

Open `lib/executeTransaction.ts` and add your Pimlico API key.

Run the local development server with the following command:
